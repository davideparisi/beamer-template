# My Beamer Template

This is my personal beamer template, it's based on a simple skeleton[^1] plus some snippets taken around[^2], feel free to fork it and change it as you like.

## Quickstart:
~~~
git clone git@github.com:davideparisi/beamer-template.git
make
~~~

view `main.pdf`

edit you own `slides.md` and recompile

## Dependencies:

this template relies on these dependencies:

- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) (by John MacFarlane)
- [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) (if you want icons on the title slide and/or  the other slides)


FontAwesome icons must be installed as System Fonts (tested on Mac Os X, just follow [this](https://coderwall.com/p/r67dyq) guide).
